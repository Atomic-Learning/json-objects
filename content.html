<p>In a JSON file, an object is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces <code class="language-json">{}</code>. The key is used to identify each value within the object. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false
}</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the object contains three key-value pairs: <code class="language-json">"name": "John Doe"</code>, <code class="language-json">"age": 30</code>, and <code class="language-json">"isStudent": false</code>. If this object related to a person it would represent that their name is John Doe, their age is 30, and they are not a student.</p>
    
<p>When defining a key-value pair, a colon separates the key (on the left) from the value (on the right) in each key-value pair. A comma separates each pair from the next. For readability, the following are conventional, but not required:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each key-element pair appears on its own line.</li>
    <li>Each key-value pair is indented compared to the curly braces (often by two or four spaces).</li>
    <li>The closing curly brace is placed on a new line, aligned with the opening curly brace.</li>
    <li>There is a space after each colon.</li>
    <li>If multiple key-value pairs are on the same line, there is a space after each comma.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an object, keys must be strings, and each key must be unique within that object. The values can be any valid JSON data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other objects.</p>
